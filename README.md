## Henning Agt-Rickauer's Homepage

Hello, my name is Henning and I am a postdoctoral researcher working on knowledge graphs, information modeling, semantic web applications, and data integration. I'm an experienced software engineer and full stack developer. For the last six years I have been working on semantic video annotation and metadata integration in the [Semantic Technologies Group](https://hpi.de/meinel/knowledge-tech/former-topics/semantics.html) of the [Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Engineering (HPI)](https://hpi.de/en) in Potsdam.

Before that, I spent five years at the [Database Systems and Information Management Group (DIMA)](https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de/), [Technische Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/), working on model-based software development with domain-specific languages and model-based data and software integration.

I obtained my PhD in computer science from the TU Berlin, where I worked on the connection between knowledge-based systems and software modeling. In particular, I used information extraction from text and knowledge graphs to build a recommender system for domain-specific modeling.
