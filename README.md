## Henning Agt-Rickauer's Homepage

Hello, my name is Henning and I am a software engineer at [DIN Software GmbH](https://www.dinsoftware.de) and work on natural language processing and AI applications in the field of standardization.

Before that I was a postdoc in the [Semantic Technologies Group](https://hpi.de/meinel/knowledge-tech/former-topics/semantics.html) of the [Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Engineering (HPI)](https://hpi.de/en) in Potsdam working on knowledge graphs, information modelling, semantic web applications and semantic video annotation.

I spent five years at the [Database Systems and Information Management Group (DIMA)](https://www.tu.berlin/dima), [Technische Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/), working on model-based software development with domain-specific languages and model-based data and software integration.

I [obtained my PhD](https://www.tu.berlin/dima/studium-lehre/abschlussarbeiten/abgeschlossene-dissertationen) in computer science from the TU Berlin, where I worked on the connection between knowledge-based systems and software modeling. In particular, I used information extraction from text and knowledge graphs to build a recommender system for domain-specific modeling.
